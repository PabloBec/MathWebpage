# MathWebpage

This project is my first approach to webpage building with ASPCore.NET and Razor, especially focused on Frontend Development. 
My main goal is to practice a new set of skills that will complement my education in Mathematics and Physics. For that reason, I am trying to develop a friendly GUI that will provide Math enthusiasts with a direct implementation of many useful algorithms.

For now, I believe the Algorithm to get the Bezout Identity for any couple of integers is functional. Discrete math algorithms like this can be pretty useful and easy to implement.


TO DO LIST:
- Euler's Totient Function.
- Matrix triangulation through Gaussian Reduction.
- Euler's Explicit Method to solve Ordinary Differential Equations.

(Note to myself: Check Modelos de Optimización en Redes for graph algorithms. Check ANM for Matrix analysis. Check Métodos Numéricos and RNEDO for nummerical integration and ODE solving.
